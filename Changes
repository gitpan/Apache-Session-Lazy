Revision history for Perl extension Apache::Session::Lazy.

0.05  Sun Feb  2 06:07:33 2003
	- Added a subroutine that could be overloaded so as to not allowing
          certain things as the session ID (the tactic of trap-ids could be
          implemented here.), or Apache::Session interface (only allow
          Session::MySQL or somat.).
        - If the tie is called via an eval() function it is now assumed that
          the user wishes to assess the validity of the session. (this will hurt
          performance, but the session will be immediately closed after the test
          so as to remove locks.)
